This is an ecommerce site similar to shopify/carousell. Built with nextjs and typescript, Users are able to create shops and products in each shop. Users are also able to purchase products from other users. 
The backend repo is named shopirousell-backend, built in nodejs, typescript, express, postgresql and prisma.

I created this because carousell is currently getting greedy and charging sellers for literally just categorizing their items and also for fun because i havent done a personal project in a while
